* Customized keymap for Dactyl Manuform 5x7 by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti
This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly
having most used symbols on a separated layer copying the common symbols from the
number keys to the second row, adding other symbols and ~◌̀~ ~◌́~ dead keys for
accents.

* Features
- Layout: Colemak DHm.
- Added redundant ~Space~, ~Tab~ and ~Enter~ keys. I like to have this keys on both halves.
- Added macro to print custom strings (~->~, ~=>~, ~../~, ~//~, ~:-)~ and ~:-(~.
- Added ~(~ and ~)~ on Shifts keys (Space Cadet Shift).
- No media layer
- "Print Screen" key.
- ~Alt~, ~Ctrl~, ~Gui~, ~Shift~ and ~Hypr~ on home keys. ~AltGr~ on bottom home row.
- Added specific layout for "AwesomeWM" window manager (currently disabled).
- Added clipboard and undo/redo macro.
- Mouse layer.

* Layout
This keyboard layout is intended to be used with English (US, intl, with dead keys) settings on PC.

On GNU/Linux systems use the following command to set the keyboard layout:
#+begin_src sh
setxkbmap -layout us -variant intl -option eurosign:e
#+end_src

* Serial connection
The default serial communication pin on the Dactyl Manuform is D0. I've soldered the wire to the D2 pin. Instead of resoldering again the wire I've simply changed the ~SOFT_SERIAL_PIN~ to ~D2~ on =config.h=.
